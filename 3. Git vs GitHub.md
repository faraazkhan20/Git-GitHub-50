**3. Git vs GitHub**

Git and GitHub are often mentioned together, but they serve different purposes. **Git** is a **local version control system**, while **GitHub** is a **cloud-based platform** that hosts Git repositories for sharing and collaboration.

Git is a tool installed on your computer that helps you **track changes**, **manage project versions**, and **work offline**. It keeps a full history of your project so you can move between versions, create branches, and recover deleted workâ€”all without internet access.

Example Git usage:

```bash
# Initialize Git
git init

# Add and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

These commands work entirely on your local machine using Git alone.

GitHub, on the other hand, is a website where you can **store your Git repositories remotely**. It allows you to **collaborate** with others, create pull requests, track issues, and review code. GitHub makes it easy to back up your work and share it with teammates or the open-source community.

To use Git with GitHub, you connect your local Git repo to a remote GitHub repository:

```bash
# Link your local Git repo to GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/my-repo.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Now your code is safely hosted online and visible on your GitHub profile.

In short: **Git manages your code history**, and **GitHub helps you collaborate and store that history in the cloud**. You can use Git without GitHub, but you cannot use GitHub effectively without understanding Git. Together, they form a powerful workflow for modern development.

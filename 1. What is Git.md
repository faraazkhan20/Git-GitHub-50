**1. What is Git?**

Git is a **distributed version control system** designed to track changes in your code and manage project versions efficiently. Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for Linux development, Git is now used by millions of developers worldwide. At its core, Git helps you **track every change** in your project, collaborate with others, and **roll back** to earlier versions when needed.

Think of Git as a time machine for your code. Instead of keeping multiple folders like “project-final-final2,” Git keeps your entire history in one directory. Every time you commit (save) your code, Git takes a **snapshot** of your files and stores it securely. This helps you identify who made what change, when, and why.

Unlike other version control systems, Git is **distributed**, meaning every developer has a full copy of the project history on their local machine. This allows you to work offline, commit locally, and sync with others only when needed.

Here's how a basic Git workflow begins in practice:

```bash
# Step 1: Create a new folder for your project
mkdir my-git-project
cd my-git-project

# Step 2: Initialize Git in this folder
git init
```

The `git init` command sets up Git in your project directory by creating a hidden `.git` folder. This folder contains all version history and configurations (The `.git` folder is hidden to prevent accidental changes, as it contains critical repository data).

You can now start tracking files:

```bash
# Step 3: Create a file and add some content
echo "Hello Git" > hello.txt

# Step 4: Add file to staging area (meaning preparing changes to be included in the next commit)
git add hello.txt

# Step 5: Commit your changes (meaning saving a snapshot of staged files to the Git history)
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

This simple flow shows Git in action—adding, staging, and saving your work. Understanding what Git is and why it exists is the foundation for becoming confident in version control and collaborative development.

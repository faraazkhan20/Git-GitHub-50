**2. Installing Git**

Before using Git, you need to install it on your system. Git supports all major operating systems—Windows, macOS, and Linux. Installation ensures that Git’s command-line tools are available on your machine, enabling you to initialize repositories, track code changes, and collaborate on projects.

**On Windows**, the easiest way to install Git is through the official installer. Go to [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/), click on “Download for Windows,” and run the `.exe` file. During installation, choose default settings unless you have specific preferences. Once installed, open the **Git Bash** terminal for Git commands (you can run all Git commands in VS Code's integrated terminal as well).

**On macOS**, if you have Homebrew installed, use the following command in Terminal:

```bash
brew install git
```

Alternatively, you can download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/). After installation, Git becomes available in your Terminal.

**On Linux**, use your system's package manager. For example, on Debian-based systems like Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

For Red Hat-based systems:

```bash
sudo dnf install git
```

After installation, verify Git by running:

```bash
git --version
```

If Git is correctly installed, you’ll see output like:

```
git version 2.42.0
```

Once installed, configure your identity so Git can label your commits. Set your username and email globally like this:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
# Run "git config --global --list" to see all globally set configurations.
```

These settings help track who made what changes across your projects.

Git is now ready to use. You can start creating repositories and managing your project versions with full control. Installation is a one-time step but a vital foundation for working with Git efficiently.

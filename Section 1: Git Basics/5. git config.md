**5. git config**

The `git config` command is used to **set and manage Git’s configuration settings**. These settings control Git’s behavior and personalize your Git environment. One of the first things you should do after installing Git is to configure your **name** and **email**, so your commits are correctly attributed.

There are three levels of configuration:

1. **System**: Applies to every user and repository on the system.
2. **Global**: Applies only to your user account.
3. **Local**: Applies only to a specific Git repository.

The most commonly used level is **global**, which is stored in `~/.gitconfig`. Let’s begin by setting your identity globally:

```bash
# Set your name
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

# Set your email
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

Every time you commit, Git tags the commit with this information.

You can also check your settings using:

```bash
git config --global --list
```

Output might look like:

```
user.name=Your Name
user.email=you@example.com
```

To set configurations only for a specific project, navigate to that repo and run:

```bash
git config user.name "Project Specific Name"
git config user.email "project@example.com"
```

This overrides the global settings, but only within that repository.

Other useful configs:

```bash
# Set default text editor
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"

# Enable colored output
git config --global color.ui auto
```

These settings are stored in configuration files and can be edited directly, but using `git config` is safer.

In short, `git config` ensures Git behaves as expected and reflects your identity, which is crucial for collaboration and commit history tracking.

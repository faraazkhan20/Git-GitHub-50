**4. git init**

The `git init` command is the **starting point** of any Git-based project. It **initializes a new Git repository** in your project folder, allowing Git to begin tracking changes to your files. Once initialized, every file you add, change, or delete can be versioned and committed using Git.

When you run `git init`, Git creates a hidden directory named `.git` inside your project folder. This `.git` folder contains all the necessary metadata and version history of your project. Without this folder, Git has no knowledge of your files.

Here’s how you use it practically:

```bash
# Create a new folder for your project
mkdir hello-git
cd hello-git

# Initialize a new Git repository
git init
```

After running this, you’ll see a message:

```
Initialized empty Git repository in /path/to/hello-git/.git/
```

Now, Git is watching your folder, but it’s not yet tracking any files. Let’s create a file and make our first commit:

```bash
# Create a new file
echo "This is my first Git file" > index.txt

# Add file to staging area ("git add ." stages all changed, new, and deleted files in the current directory)
git add index.txt

# Commit the file
git commit -m "First commit with index.txt"
```

The `git init` command is used **once per project**, right at the beginning. It works for both new projects and existing codebases you want to start tracking with Git.

You can also use `git init` inside an existing code folder to start tracking its contents:

```bash
cd existing-project
git init
```

Git will not touch your existing files; it will only start tracking them from that point on. In summary, `git init` is the command that turns any folder into a Git-managed project, setting the stage for version control.
